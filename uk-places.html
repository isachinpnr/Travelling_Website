                <p class="text-grey">Mussoorie, also known as Queen of the Hills, is among the most popular hill
                    stations of the country. A Britisher, Captain Frederick Young, accompanied by an official named FJ
                    Shore, had climbed up the hill from the Doon valley in 1827 and found this ridge offering great
                    views and a salubrious climate. This visit laid the foundation for this grand hill station.
                    A captivating paradise for leisure travellers and honeymooners, it is a perfect summer resort.
                    Located on a 15-km-long horseshoe ridge with the grand Himalayas as a backdrop, Mussoorie spreads
                    across at a height of 2,000 m above sea level. From this vantage point, it offers scenic views of
                    Himalayas peaks in Western Garhwal.
                    Many famous personalities have made Mussoorie their home – most notable being authors Ruskin Bond
                    and Bill Aitken. Filmstar Victor Banerjee resides in Mussoorie while deceased filmstar Tom Alter was
                    born and brought up here. In the 1960s filmstar Prem Nath had his house here while the son of Dev
                    Anand studied in Woodstock school. Cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are frequent
                    visitors to this hill resort.
                    Best time to go
                    The best time to visit Mussoorie is during summers, as it offers respite from the scorching summer
                    heat. However, if you are looking for a secluded holiday, come here during winters to witness the
                    snowfall.

                <p class="text-grey">Kedarkantha (not to be confused with the popular Temple Kedarnath) is a 6-day long
                    trek in Govind Pashu Vihar National Park in Uttarakhand (6 when including the travel days from
                    Dehradun to the base camp and back). Kedarkantha is easily one of the most popular treks in India —
                    popular amongst seasoned trekkers and beginners alike.

                    There are many reasons why it is a very popular trek to do in the Indian Himalayas. The most
                    important of them is this — the summit climb.

                    The summit climb of Kedarkantha is a very rewarding one. Right from the base camp of the trek, the
                    summit looms large. As you start your trek in the early hours of the morning and steadily climb up
                    the steep slope, the world opens up around you.

                    The climb is not easy. The entire stretch is steadily steep. As you get closer to the summit, it
                    gets tricky as well. But the big mountains of the upper Himalayas keep you company until you finally
                    reach the summit.

                    As you stretch yourself and take in the views of the Himalayas from the summit, you feel a strong
                    sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. This is an unparalleled feeling.

                    Very few treks offer the same adventure, making it popular among beginners for its finest summit
                    climb.</p>

            <p class="">CHAR DHAM
                Uttarakhand, also known as Devbhoomi or the Land of Gods, is home to numerous temples and welcomes
                devotees all year round. Among the countless religious sites and circuits that devotees visit in
                Uttarakhand, one of the most prominent is the Char Dham Yatra. This Yatra or pilgrimage is a tour of
                four holy sites - Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath – nestled high up in the Himalayas. In
                Hindi, 'char' means four and 'dham' refers to religious destinations.

                The high-altitude shrines remain shut for around six months every year, opening in summers (April or
                May) and closing with the onset of winter (October or November). It is believed that one should complete
                the Char Dham Yatra in a clockwise direction. Hence, the pilgrimage starts from Yamunotri, proceeds
                towards Gangotri, onto Kedarnath, and finally ends at Badrinath. The journey can be completed by road or
                by air (helicopter services are available). Some devotees even do a Do Dham Yatra or a pilgrimage to two
                shrines - Kedarnath and Badrinath.

                The Yamunotri temple, lodged in a narrow gorge close to the source of River Yamuna (the second-most
                sacred Indian river after River Ganga) in Uttarkashi district, is dedicated to Goddess Yamuna. The
                district of Uttarkashi is also home to Gangotri dedicated to Goddess Ganga, the most sacred of all
                Indian rivers. Located in the Rudraprayag district lies Kedarnath, dedicated to Lord Shiva. Badrinath,
                home to the sacred Badrinarayan Temple, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The Char Dham Yatra is as divine as
                it is arduous but fulfills the soul!</p>
