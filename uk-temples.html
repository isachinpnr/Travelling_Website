                    Literally, "Har" means "God", "Ki" means " 's " and "Pauri" means "steps". Lord Vishnu is believed

                    The ghat is on the west bank of Ganges canal through which the Ganges is diverted just to the north.
                    Har Ki Pauri is also the area where thousands of pilgrims converge and the festivities commence

                    elevation of 2,200 m (7,217.8 ft) in the picturesque Urgam valley in the Garhwal region of
                    Uttarakhand state in India. The temple's ancient legend linked to the Pandavas, heroes of the epic
                    Mahabharata, is the fifth temple of the Panch Kedar (five temples) of Shiva's five anatomical divine
                    forms; the other four temples in the order of their worship are Kedarnath, Rudranath, Tungnath and
                    Madhyamaheshwar temples; all in the Kedar Khand region of the Garhwal Himalayas.[1][2][3] Kalpeshwar
                    is the only Panch Kedar temple accessible throughout the year. At this small stone temple,
                    approached through a cave passage, the matted tress (jata) of Lord Shiva is worshipped. Hence, Lord
                    Shiva is also called as Jatadhar or Jateshwar. Earlier it was approachable only by 12 km (7.5 mi)
                    trek from the nearest road head of Helang on the Rishikesh-Badrinath road but now the road goes up
                    to Devgram village from where the trek now is just 300 metres. This road is good for bikes or cars
                    with good ground clearance as it is a half-paved road which may get damaged during monsoons. Small
                    cars can be taken except in monsoons.[1].</p>

                    Location
                    This temple lies 128 km. from Dehradun, and 35 km. from Chakrata on the Mussoorie-Yamnotri road,
                    past Kempty Falls.[3] It is built in North Indian Architectural style, which is common in the hilly

                    where the temple is situated.

                    Lakhamandal gets its name from the two words: lakha (Lakh) meaning "many" and mandals meaning
                    "temples" or "lingam". Plenty of artistic works were found in the excavations by the Archaeological

            <p class=""> Uttarakhand, also known as Devbhoomi or the Land of Gods, is home to numerous temples and
                welcomes
                devotees all year round. Among the countless religious sites and circuits that devotees visit in
                Uttarakhand, one of the most prominent is the Char Dham Yatra. This Yatra or pilgrimage is a tour of
                four holy sites - Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath – nestled high up in the Himalayas. In
                Hindi, 'char' means four and 'dham' refers to religious destinations.

                The high-altitude shrines remain shut for around six months every year, opening in summers (April or
                May) and closing with the onset of winter (October or November). It is believed that one should complete
                the Char Dham Yatra in a clockwise direction. Hence, the pilgrimage starts from Yamunotri, proceeds
                towards Gangotri, onto Kedarnath, and finally ends at Badrinath. The journey can be completed by road or
                by air (helicopter services are available). Some devotees even do a Do Dham Yatra or a pilgrimage to two
                shrines - Kedarnath and Badrinath.

                The Yamunotri temple, lodged in a narrow gorge close to the source of River Yamuna (the second-most
                sacred Indian river after River Ganga) in Uttarkashi district, is dedicated to Goddess Yamuna. The
                district of Uttarkashi is also home to Gangotri dedicated to Goddess Ganga, the most sacred of all
                Indian rivers. Located in the Rudraprayag district lies Kedarnath, dedicated to Lord Shiva. Badrinath,
                home to the sacred Badrinarayan Temple, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The Char Dham Yatra is as divine as
                it is arduous but fulfills the soul!</p>
